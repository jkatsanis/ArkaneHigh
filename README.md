# ArkaneOS
A very small operating system working only in kernel lol.

## Tools used
- Programming language: Assembly, C++
- Makefile
- GDB (debug)

## Technical info

- 64 BIT
- Qeemu for the .bin file

## Some shit
So the idea is to have a os with alot of kernel features, and you can create programs that even directly use those features without sys calls or whatever so for example you can subscribe to a OnKeyboardPress function that gets called directly from the idt ye
